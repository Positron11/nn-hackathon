# Subphenotypes

## SIDD (Severe Insulin-Deficient Diabetes)

- Core pathophysiology: Profound β-cell failure with low C-peptide, low HOMA-B, and relatively preserved insulin sensitivity.

- Clinical profile: Early onset, low BMI and waist circumference, markedly high HbA1c and fasting glucose.

## SIRD (Severe Insulin-Resistant Diabetes)

- Core pathophysiology: Marked insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinemia and elevated β-cell function (HOMA-B high).

- Clinical profile: Highest BMI and C-peptide levels; high HOMA-IR; often middle-aged with features of metabolic syndrome.

## CIRDD (Combined Insulin-Resistant and Deficient Diabetes)

- Core pathophysiology: Dual defect—significant insulin resistance co-existing with β-cell dysfunction.

- Clinical profile: Intermediate BMI and HOMA indices (between SIRD and SIDD); lowest HDL and highest triglycerides and HbA1c.

## MOD (Mild Obesity-Related Diabetes)

- Core pathophysiology: Obesity-linked dysglycemia with preserved insulin sensitivity and β-cell function.

- Clinical profile: Higher BMI but lower HOMA-IR than SIRD; relatively mild hyperglycemia and better lipid profile.

## MARD (Mild Age-Related Diabetes)

- Core pathophysiology: Gradual β-cell decline with age; mild insulin resistance.

- Clinical profile: Oldest age at diagnosis, preserved C-peptide, mild hyperglycemia, and best metabolic control.
